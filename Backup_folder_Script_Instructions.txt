This PowerShell script synchronizes the contents of a source folder with a replica folder, ensuring that the replica folder is an exact copy of the source folder. The script logs all file operations to a specified log file and outputs the same information to the console.

	~ Features ~
-> One-way synchronization: Content in the replica folder is updated to match the source folder.
-> Logging: All operations (file creation, copying, and removal) are logged to a specified file and the console.
-> Path Validation: Ensures the provided paths are valid directories.

	~ Instructions ~

1) Start the Script: The script begins by displaying "Starting script" and logs the current date and time.
2) Input Validation: The user is prompted to enter the source and replica folder paths. The script validates these paths to ensure they are valid directories.
3) Verify Replica Folder: The script checks if the replica folder exists. If not, it creates the folder.
4) Verify Log File: The script checks if the log file exists. If not, it creates a new log file and logs the start time.
	 ~ Synchronize Folders ~
-> The script loops through all items in the source folder.
-> It copies directories and files from the source folder to the replica folder.
-> Remove Non-synced Items: The script removes any items in the replica folder that are not present in the source folder.
-> Log Completion: The script logs the completion of the synchronization process.

	~ Notes ~

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read from the source folder and write to the replica folder.
The script excludes the log file from being copied to the replica folder to avoid conflicts.
